# Practice Lab: Using BitLocker

## Summary

In this exercise you will learn how to encrypt a local drive using BitLocker.

### Scenario

Adatum engineering department has a Windows 10 computer that has sensitive data
store on the E drive. Engineering needs access to this data, but IT has concerns
about the location's security and concerns with equipment theft. You have
decided to implement BitLocker to protect the userâ€™s data files that are stored
on the local drive (E:).

### Task 1: Configure GPO settings

1. Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password
    **Pa55w.rd**.

1. In the T**ype here to search box** on the taskbar, type **gpedit.msc**, and
    then press Enter.

1. In the Local Group Policy Editor, under **Computer Configuration** node,
    expand **Administrative Templates**, expand **Windows Components**, and then
    expand **BitLocker Drive Encryption**.

1. Select **Operating System Drives**, and then double-click **Require
    additional authentication at startup**.

1. In the **Require additional authentication at startup** dialog box, select
    **Enabled**, and then select **OK**.

1. Close all open windows.

### Task 2: Enable BitLocker

1. Select the **File Explorer** icon on the taskbar.

1. In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, expand **This PC**.

1. In the navigation pane, right-click Allfiles (E:), and then select **Turn on
    BitLocker**.

1. In the **BitLocker Drive Encryption (E:)** dialog box, select **Use a
    password to unlock the drive**.

1. In the **Enter your password** and **Reenter your password** boxes, type
    **Pa55w.rd**, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **How do you want to back up your recovery key?** page, select **Save
    to a file**.

1. In the **Save BitLocker recovery key as** dialog box, select **Local Disk
    (C:)**.

1. Select **New folder**, type **BitLocker**, and then press Enter.

1. In the **Save BitLocker recovery key as** dialog box, select **Open**, and
    then select **Save**,

1. On the **How do you want to back up your recovery key?** page, select
    **Next**.

1. On the **Choose how much of your drive to encrypt** page, ensure that
    **Encrypt used disk space only (faster and best for new PCs and drives)** is
    selected, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Choose which encryption mode to use** page, ensure that **New
    encryption mode (best for fixed drives on this device)** is selected, and
    then select **Next**.

1. On the **BitLocker Drive Encryption (E:)** page, select **Start
    encrypting**, and then select **Close**.

1. Wait until the drive is fully encrypted. The progress is shown by the
    BitLocker icon in the notification area

1. Restart LON-CL1.

### Task 3: Verify BitLocker

1. Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password
    **Pa55w.rd**.

1. Select the **File Explorer** icon on the taskbar.

1. In File Explorer in the navigation pane expand **This PC**, and select
    **Local Disk (E:)**.

1. In the BitLocker (E:) window, enter the password **Pa55w.rd**, press Enter
    to unlock the drive, and then verify access to the drive contents.  
  
    _Note: In the rest of this lab in this module, you must always enter the
    password to unlock the E: drive after a reboot._

1. Close all open windows.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured
BitLocker to encrypt a local drive.
