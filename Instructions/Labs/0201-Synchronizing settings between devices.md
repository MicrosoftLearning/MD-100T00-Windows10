_Dependency Note: Task 1 in Exercise 1 of this lab must be completed (or an
available Microsoft ID) to perform additional labs later in this course._

### Scenario

You frequently use two devices, LON-CL1 and LON-CL3, and would like to ensure
that Windows settings and Microsoft Edge favorites are synchronized between the
two devices. You've decided to use a new Microsoft Account to do this.


### Task 1: Connect your Microsoft account

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password
    **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  Select **Start**, and then select the **Settings** icon.

3.  In the **Settings** app select **Accounts.**

4.  In the navigation pane select **Other users,** and then select **Add someone
    else to this PC.**

5.  In the **Microsoft account** window, select **I don't have this person's
    sign-in information**.

6.  In the **Microsoft account** window, select **Get a new email address**.

7.  Create a Microsoft account with the following values, and then select
    **Next**:

    -   *New email: Your first name + Last name’s first letter (for example,
        KariT) + **MD100***

    -   *First name: Your first name*

    -   *Last name: Your last name*

    -   *Password: Pa55w.rd123*

    -   *Country/region: your country or region*

    -   *Birth day: 1*

    -   *Year: 1990*

    _Note: If you select a country or region other than the United States, the
birth date boxes do not appear. This is expected behavior, and you do not
need to enter a birth date in this scenario._

    and then select **Send code**. When you receive the code, type it in the
    **Enter the access code** box and select **Next**.

number to receive the verification code._

3.  Enter a **4-digit PIN** that you will remember into both fields and select
